Go through inode list, check blocks used by each inode
* Record data blocks listed twice
* Record data blocks listed as free
Go through directory listing 
* Check for inodes not in the inode listing
* Check for inode counts not equal to number of times directories link to them
* Check that . lists to the same directory entry and that .. links to the parent
Check inode free list for inodes marked used and not in use
Check block pointers that point to blocks that are invalid in the fs
	* EG 0, 1, more than max
